# Hey! 👋

I'm Paul, a philosophy graduate turned Python developer who got fascinated by AI and data analysis.

## Background

Did my BA in Philosophy and Master's in Cognitive Science. Fell in love with statistics during my studies and realized I wanted to build things that actually work with data. Now I'm coding and trying to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine learning.

## What I work with

- **Python** - main language for everything
- **Data analysis** - statistics, SQL, working with real datasets
- **AI/ML** - exploring how to build smarter applications
- **Backend development** - clean architecture, databases, APIs

## Current projects

**[CliniTrack](https://github.com/paulsergiupopescu-afk/CliniTrack)** - Management system with analytics engine. Built this to practice working with relational data and generating business insights. The fun part was figuring out how to turn raw appointment data into meaningful trends.

**AI Therapy Chatbot** *(coming soon)* - Working on a conversational AI that can provide therapeutic support. Combining my cognitive science background with RAG architecture to make something actually useful for mental health.

## What drives me

Honestly? I'm fascinated by how minds work, both human and artificial. Love digging into data to find patterns, building systems that help people, and figuring out how to make AI more human-like.

Statistics was my gateway drug into programming. There's something satisfying about cleaning messy data and making it tell a story.

## Looking for

Junior dev or internship roles where I can work on AI, data analysis, or backend systems. Especially interested in projects that have a human element - healthcare, education, or anything that helps people make better decisions.
